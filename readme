# 🔥 Flask API – My First Step into Backend Development

Welcome to my first Flask API project. This isn’t just a beginner's repo — it’s a record of curiosity, frustration, trial, and learning. I’m new to Python and backend development, but I’ve been exploring aggressively, experimenting with Machine Learning, Flask, and more.

## 📖 What This Project Is

- A simple Flask API I built as a fresher in Python.
- It handles basic API functionality using routes, GET/POST requests, and returns JSON responses.
- You can run and test this API to understand basic backend architecture with Flask.

## 🧠 My Learning Journey

This project isn't about showing off — it's about showing up.  
When I started, I had zero idea what an API was. But here’s what kept me going: **curiosity, consistency, and chaos in my brain that wanted to build something.**

### ❓ The Questions I Faced:
- What even are *routes* in Flask?
- Where does the data go in an API?
- Can we do more than just GET and POST?
- Why do we need APIs? Why not just write functions?
- Why is there no module called `api` that makes APIs easy?
- Is Flask only for JSON responses?
- And most importantly — ***WTF is Flask?***

These questions haunted me — but also drove me.

## 🛠️ How I Solved Them

I didn’t rely on just tutorials. Instead, I:

- Built small Flask apps from scratch
- Ran and modified example projects
- Served HTML pages using Flask to get used to route handling
- Kept experimenting and asking questions on ChatGPT and forums

Eventually, things clicked.

## 🎓 Useful Resources That Actually Helped Me

If you're also a beginner, avoid the overwhelming noise. These 3 tutorials genuinely helped me:

1. [Flask REST API Tutorial](https://youtu.be/z3YMz-Gocmw?si=dy3zmbTVc4WjorCc)
2. [Simple Flask API with Postman](https://youtu.be/L9q3vjpwsh8?si=2f26ZGIBPI9whnaB)
3. [Flask Beginner Guide](https://youtu.be/WA4OcJ-9PJo?si=tslZtP3-gNg_XTjb)

Also, I *highly recommend* using ChatGPT (or another AI assistant) to ask real-time questions when you're stuck — it saved me hours.
